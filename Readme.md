# Lunar Seismic Map Project

## Introduction

This project is a visualization of lunar seismic activity built using JavaScript, Three.js, and embedded into a custom-built web application. The goal of this project is to provide a visual representation of the seismic activity on the moon to help scientists and researchers better understand the composition and structure of the moon's interior.

## Frameworks Used

This project was built using the following frameworks:

- **JavaScript**: A high-level programming language used to build the logic of the application.
- **Three.js**: A JavaScript library used to create and display 3D graphics in a web browser. It was used to create the lunar surface and the visual representation of the seismic activity.
- **React**: A JavaScript library used to build the user interface of the web application.
- **Webpack**: A module bundler used to bundle the JavaScript and other assets of the project.
- **Babel**: A JavaScript compiler used to transpile the modern JavaScript code into a format that can run in all modern web browsers.

## Installation

To use this project, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. If you don't have these installed, you can download and install them from the official Node.js website.

Once you have Node.js and npm installed, clone the repository from GitHub and navigate to the project directory in your terminal. Then, run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm start

```

This will install the necessary dependencies and start the development server.

## Usage

Once the development server is running, you can view the lunar seismic map by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. The map can be interacted with using your mouse and keyboard to zoom in and out, rotate, and pan around the moon's surface.

The map is color-coded to represent different levels of seismic activity, with warmer colors indicating higher levels of activity and cooler colors indicating lower levels of activity. This allows scientists and researchers to quickly identify areas of interest and focus their research efforts accordingly.

## Credits

This project was developed by [Team Lunar Seismic Map](https://github.com/team-lunar-seismic-map) for the NASA hackathon.

We hope that this project will help to advance our understanding of the moon's interior and contribute to future missions to the moon and beyond.
