# Lunar Seismic Map Project

## Introduction

This project is a visualization of lunar seismic activity built using JavaScript, Three.js, and embedded into a custom-built web application. The goal of this project is to provide a visual representation of the seismic activity on the moon to help scientists and researchers better understand the composition and structure of the moon's interior. It was built for NASA's Space APP hackathon.

## Frameworks Used

This project was built using the following frameworks:

- **JavaScript**
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **Three.js**: A JavaScript library used to create and display 3D graphics in a web browser. It was used to create the lunar surface and the visual representation of the seismic activity.

## Installation

To use this project, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. If you don't have these installed, you can download and install them from the official Node.js website.

Once you have Node.js and npm installed, clone the repository from GitHub and navigate to the project directory in your terminal. Then, run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm start

```

This will install the necessary dependencies and start the development server.

## Usage

Once the development server is running, you can view the lunar seismic map by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. The map can be interacted with using your mouse and keyboard to zoom in and out, rotate, and pan around the moon's surface.
